#Project: Data Modeling with Postgres


##Prerequisite:
->Download and Install Python 3.8.3: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/
->Add Python to Environment Variables:
  Step 1: Right click on computer or PC and go to "Properties"
  Step 2: Click "Environment Variables"
  Step 3: Under "System Variables" click on "Path"
  Step 4: Define you Python path by clicking "Add" (Ex: 
  C:\Users\Garav Soni\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts
  C:\Users\Garav Soni\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\)
  Step5: Your Python will now be accessible by IDE
->Download and install Visual Code Studio: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
->Download and install PIP: Go to "https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/" to look at the full documentation on the installation process
->Use the command to "pip install pycodestyle" to install Pycodestyle which checks for PIP guidelines.
##How to run:





##Summary of Project:
->This is the first project for the Udacity Data Engineering NanoDegree. In this project, you have to use your knowledge of
on data modeling with Postgres and build an EFL Pipeline using Python. We have to define face and dimension tables for a star schema. In addition,
we have ETF pipeline that transfers data from the Song and Log files into Postgres using Python and Postgres

##Steps to do the Project:
1. The first step to this project is to create the Fact table and dimension tables with the respective properties for each using the "Create" query in the sql_queries.py file.
2. The next step is to "Insert", so that we can prepare to insert the data from the log data file and song data file in the sql_queries.py file. 
3. The final step is to create a "SELECT" query to select the accurate song.
4. After we have finished creating the queries in the sql_queries.py, then we have to go to the
